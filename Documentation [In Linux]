Steps taken [In Linux]:
	1. Removed "std::" and used "using namespace std;" instead
	2. Installed libsdl2-dev thru terminal:
			apt-get install libsdl2-dev
	3. Wrote a Makefile for easier terminal command (See Makefile)
	4. Added "#include <SDL.h>"
	5. Added "-lSDL2" in the LIBRARY_LINKS of my Makefile 
	6. Included the path where my SDL2 is intalled in: "-I/usr/include/SDL2" (See Makefile)
	7. Errors not due to SDL2 library:
		-‘nullptr’ was not declared in this scope
			Solution:
				nullptr is a C++11 keyword. So in order to access it with the g++ compiler, I have to add -std=c++11 in my terminal command. (See Makefile)
		-‘roundedBoxColor’ was not declared in this scope
			Solution:
				Downloaded SDL2_gfx library and followed the instructions from:
					http://cms.ferzkopp.net/index.php/software/13-sdl-gfx
				Added "#include "SDL2_gfxPrimitives.h"
				Added -lSDL2_gfx in the LIBRARY_LINKS of my Makefile (See Makefile)
				Added the path where my SDL2_gfx header files are located: -I/usr/local/include/SDL2 (See Makefile)
		-‘tex’ was not declared in this scope
			Solution:
				Commented out due to undeclared tex texture.
